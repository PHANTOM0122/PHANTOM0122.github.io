**Abstract**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have successfully classified EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI)
systems. However, recent studies have found that welldesigned input samples, known as adversarial examples,
can easily fool well-performed deep neural networks model
with minor perturbations undetectable by a human. This
paper proposes an efficient generative model named generative perturbation network (GPN), which can generate
universal adversarial examples with the same architecture for non-targeted and targeted attacks. Furthermore,
the proposed model can be efficiently extended to conditionally or simultaneously generate perturbations for various targets and victim models. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that perturbations generated by the
proposed model outperform previous approaches for crafting signal-agnostic perturbations. We demonstrate that the
extended network for signal-specific methods also significantly reduces generation time while performing similarly.
The transferability across classification networks of the
proposed method is superior to the other methods, which
shows our perturbationsâ€™ high level of generality.
