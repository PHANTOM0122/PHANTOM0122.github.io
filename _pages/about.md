## About Me 👨‍💻
👋 Hi there, I'm Heejoon. Thanks for visiting my website! ✨ 
 
I'm a 2nd-year Integrated MS-Ph.D. student at Hanyang university, [Spatial AI Lab](https://www.sailab.kr/
) (Advisor: Prof. [Je Hyeong Hong](https://zrr.kr/YkZK)).     
Previously, I was an undergraduate researcher at [AIR (AI & Robotics) Lab](http://airlab.khu.ac.kr/
), advised by Prof. [Hyosoek Hwang](https://zrr.kr/OzVb) at KyungHee University.     

## Research Interests 📚

- **Geometric Computer Vision:** Visual Localization, 3D Line Geometry, Structure-from-Motion
- **Embodied AI:** Sensor Fusion Based Perception in Robotics & Autonomous Vehicles   
- **Spatial AI:** 3D Foundation Models, Implicit Scene Representations
